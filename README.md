Emulation of my coffee machine in Rust (learning purpose only)

## How it works

This coffee machine can make 2 types of coffee (expresso and american) and also can pour hot water.

For this to proper function we need to suply with coffee or water if there's not enough, or to empty the dump if it's full.
